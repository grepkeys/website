title: "Apple Wireless Keyboard"

Git gud and buy a real keyboard. Seriously though, the Apple Wireless Keyboard is a keyboard produced by Apple to be used with their desktop computers but can also be bought separately. As the name implies, it is able to connect wirelessly to any computer with Bluetooth. This keyboard uses a rubber dome on membrane switch with a scissor mechanism. This keyboard lacks a number pad and many other keys that MacOS users don't tend to use such as the insert, delete, print screen and other keys in that cluster. These two factors result in a keyboard that is very compact and easy to carry around. The keycaps are thin, chiclet style keycaps that tend to show dirt very easily.

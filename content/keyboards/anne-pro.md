The Anne Pro 2 is a keyboard by Obinslab that has quickly grown to become one of the most popular keyboards for enthusiasts that haven't yet built their own custom keyboard and is rivalling the [Ducky One 2 Mini](/keyboards/ducky-one-2) in popularity due to them both filling a similar niche. 

Both these keyboards are 60% keyboards but still maintain everyone function a keyboard is required to fulfil. The 60% size is popular for both enthusiasts and amateurs alike due to the added customizability and smaller footprint. Due to the small size, the Anne Pro 2 is able to be customised to a much greater extent than 80% or 100% sized keyboards. In the [keyboard enthusiast community](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/), 60% keyboards are the most popular size and therefore there are more keycap sets and cases available. The small footprint allows for extra room for mouse movements for the many gamers playing on ridiculously low DPI and sensitivity. 

Another large selling point for the Anne Pro 2 is the large variety of switches that are available. This keyboard comes with switches from Cherry, Gateron and Kailh allowing people to buy from the three most mainstream switch manufacturers and decide whether to pay more for Cherry switches or save many and go with Kailh or Gateron switches. Ironically, among enthusiasts, they generally regard Kailh and Gateron as better switches than Cherry while being cheaper to buy at the same time.

When buying an Anne Pro 2, inside the box, you will receive a cable to connect the keyboard, a wired keycap puller, a variety of coloured keycaps without a legend printed on, a manual and, of course, the keyboard itself.

Overall, the Anne Pro 2 is a great keyboard. Either this or a Ducky keyboard are the best ways to begin your descent into the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole. This keyboard has every feature you need from a keyboard whilst being priced fairly unlike the 'gaming' keyboards from brands such as Corsair and Razer.

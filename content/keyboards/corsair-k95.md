The Corsair K95 RGB Platinum is a keyboard produced by the popular PC hardware brand Corsair. It was designed to be a no compromises board containing as many features as Corsair could pack into the board. The features this board contains are a detachable wrist rest with reversible rubber to change the texture, 6 extra keys dedicated to macros, many media keys including a volume scroll, onboard profile storage with buttons to switch between profiles, USB passthrough, NKey rollover and RGB lights with Corsair iCUE support.

The Corsair K95 RGB Platinum, as the name implies, is only available with RGB LEDs inside. Through the use of iCUE, these lights can be customised to either custom patterns or one of the many preloaded patterns. To add to the RGB lights underneath the keys, the Corsair logo and a bar across the top of keyboard also contain lights that can be customised along with the keys.

Overall, the K95 RGB Platinum is a decent keyboard if you have the money for it and really want the features it provides. However, for $250, this keyboard is very expensive for what it offers. The limited selection of switches along with the ABS keycaps makes this keyboard even harder to recommend for this pricepoint. For a budget of $250, you could buy a much better keyboard from a brand with better build quality or maybe even a low-end custom keyboard that you can build yourself.

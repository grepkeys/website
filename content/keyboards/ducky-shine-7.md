The Ducky Shine 7 is Ducky's top tier keyboard and is one of the best boards you can get without custom building a keyboard by yourself. This keyboard is currently only available as a 100% keyboard and has the exact same layout as the full size [Ducky One 2](/keyboards/ducky-one-2) with 3 volume keys and a calculator key above the number pad. Other features it shares with the One 2 are doubleshot PBT keycaps and a set of randomly coloured spare keycaps including arrow keys, 3 escape keys, enter keys for both the normal enter and number pad enter, a Ducky Year of the Dogâ„¢ spacebar, wire keycap puller and an easily detatchable USB Type-C cable. The top plate of the keyboard is made of a zinc alloy. Ducky claims this material is 3 times more durable than aluminium.

As the name implies, this keyboard was designed with RGB in mind. The lights in this keyboard are embedded into the PCB and are able to shine through the clear switches. These LEDs have been specifically chosen by Ducky for the brighter lighting they supply. To allow for even brighter lighting, the casing underneath the keycaps is white. The RGB effects in the Ducky Shine 7 can be customised using Ducky's RGB software however this is not required because the keyboard has numerous patterns preloaded onto the board that can be changed at any time.

The Ducky One 2 Series is a series of keyboards from the popular brand Ducky. Ducky are well known for the great build quality of all their boards. All Ducky One 2 boards come with PBT Doubleshot keycaps and many different Cherry MX switches. These boards come in a variety of colours and sizes. For 100% and 80% keyboards, you can get the Blue LED, White LED, RGB, Skyline or Horizon boards. If you like smaller boards and don't mind a longer wait, the Ducky One 2 Mini is for you!

All of these keyboards come with PBT doubleshot keycaps for enhanced durability over the typical ABS "gaming" keyboards. These boards also come with a wire keycap puller. The RGB keyboards come with extra keycaps for the enter key, wasd keys, three extra options for the escape key and a Ducky Year of the Dog spacebar.

The RGB models come with full RGB lights in the PCB with clear switch housings for the lights to shine through. The blue and white LED keyboards are the same but with their respective colour. 

Available with Cherry MX blacks, browns, blues, reds, nature whites, silvers, silent reds, greens and clears depending on the colour/style of the keyboard.

The Razer Huntsman Elite is Razer's current top keyboard in terms of both functionality and price. Out of all of Razer's keyboards, this is the one with the most features such as a detachable wrist rest, RGB lights with many effects and ways to get more, keycaps that don't use a disgusting font, a gaming mode that disables the windows key and a programmable scroll wheel. 

This keyboard is the one of two keyboards that can be bought with the Razer Purple switch. As described in the article for the [Razer Opto-mechanical switch](/switches/razer-purple) this keyboard has been designed with a laser inside the switch that allows for increased durability and faster actuation. 

Overall, there really isn't much to say about this keyboard. As far as I'm aware, it's just a [Blackwidow Elite](/keyboards/razer-blackwidow) with a newer type of switch and an extra $100 added to the price. For around $300 this keyboard is definitely not worth it unless you truly need an opto-mechanical switch. If you truly need Razer's newest switch, it is better to get a Razer Hunstman instead of the elite version. The main differences are the non-elite version doesn't have a wrist rest or dedicated media keys. Keep in mind, the difference between the two models is about $80. For that price, you could buy a wrist rest separately and still have spent less than if you just bought the Huntsman Elite.

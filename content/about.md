Hello and welcome to GrepKeys.
This website has been set up to help inform you about keyboards in an effort to assist you with buying your first keyboard. Each keyboard page contains a description of the features of the keyboard, the available switches, a sound test and a link to the place we recommend purchasing the keyboard.

This website was made as a school project for our software class. We made this website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the Unix Shell. This website was made by [twdly](https://github.com/twdly) and [arzg](https://github.com/arzg) and our source code can be found [here](https://github.com/grepkeys/website).

But remember: *the red switch is linear* (it's an inside joke â€“ don't worry about it).

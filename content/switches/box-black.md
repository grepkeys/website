The Kailh Box Black is a clone of the [Cherry MX Black](/switches/cherry-black) with a different style of stem similar to the newer versions of Razer switches. This stem was designed to make the switch more durable to dust and moisture. The Box Black's only difference to the MX Black is a slightly shortened actuation distance of 1.8 millimetres compared to the MX Black's 2 millimetre actuation point.

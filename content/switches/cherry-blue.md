The Cherry MX Blue switch is a switch from Cherry known for its extremely loud clickiness, and pronounced tactility. It has an operating force of fifty grams, which is little compared to heavier switch versions such as the [Cherry MX Green](/switches/cherry-green), but still more than the forty-five grams of the [Cherry MX Red](/switches/cherry-red). Blues have an actuation point of 2.2 millimetres, again more than the Reds. The tactile bump is significantly more noticeable than the [Browns](/switches/cherry-brown)' ones. In fact, the difference is so pronounced that doubts have been raised about the tactile status of Browns in the first place. Anyways, I'm getting off track here.

In conclusion, the tactility and (relatively) heavy operating force have resulted in the Cherry MX Blue being favoured for typing over gaming.

The Cherry MX Blue switch is a switch from Cherry known for it's loud clickiness and tactility. It has an operating force of fifty grams and an actuation point of 2.2 millimetres. The tactile bump is significantly more noticeable than the one of the Cherry MX Brown. This and the heavier operating force have resulted in the switch being favoured for typing over gaming.

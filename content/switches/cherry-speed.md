The Cherry MX Speed is a switch that was designed with gaming in the mind. The theory behind it is that a shorter actuation distance means there is less time between attempting to press a key and the keystroke registering. The result is a linear switch similar to the [MX Red](/switches/cherry-red) but with a mere 1.2mm actuation distance. The 0.8mm difference between the speeds and other switches such as browns and reds may not seem like much but many people have stated that swapping to the speeds initially felt very strange. Many people have said that when using speeds, they accidentally press the keys simply by resting their hands lightly on top of the keycaps. 

The main problem with the MX Speeds is how niche they are. The very tiny difference in actuation distance will only make a difference if you are playing games at the very highest tiers. Even then, the difference will be very minor. This results in this switch being quite hard to recommend due to [MX Reds](/switches/cherry-red), [Blues](/switches/cherry-blue) and [Browns](/switches/cherry-brown) being much more readily available and, in the vast majority of scenarios, will perform just as well as the Speed switches.

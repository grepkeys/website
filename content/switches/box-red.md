The Kailh Box Red is a clone of the [Cherry MX Red](/switches/cherry-red) with a different style of stem similar to the newer versions of Razer switches. This stem was designed to make the switch more durable to dust and moisture. The Box Red's only difference to the MX Red is a slightly shortened actuation distance of 1.8 millimetres compared to the MX Red's 2 millimetre actuation point.

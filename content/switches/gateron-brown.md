The Gateron Brown is just a clone of [Cherry MX Browns](/switches/cherry-brown) but with a different spring. The change of spring results in a lighter actuation force but mechanical keyboard enthusiasts have noted that the springs make an irritating squeaking noise.

The Gateron Brown, similar to the MX Brown has a tiny bump that isn't quite tactile (sometimes described as a grain of sand being stuck inside the switch) but a slightly lessened actuation force of 45g.

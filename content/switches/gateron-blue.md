The Gateron Blue is essentially just a clone of [Cherry MX Blues](/switches/cherry-blue). For this switch, Gateron took Cherry's design, improved it and made it cheaper. Just like the MX Blue, this switch has a loud, tactical bump and a similar actuation force. Many people who have used this switch have decided that the Gateron Blue, despite being a clone, feels better than the MX Blue. This is because the Gateron Blue feels much smoother to press due to the way Gateron molds their sliders. On the other hand, Cherry's slider molding method causes a rough surface on the slider making their switches very scratchy to type on. For someone who has only typed with Cherry switches, this mightn't be noticable but is something hardcore mechanical keyboard users will hate.

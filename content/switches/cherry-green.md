The Cherry MX Green is a switch that is very similar to the [Cherry MX Blue](/switches/cherry-blue). The Green switch inherits the clickiness and tactility of the Blues, but with one major difference; it is slightly heavier. With weight, of course, we mean the force you need to apply to the switch for it to reach the actuation point. To be precise, the Green switch requires eighty grams to actuate, in contrast to the Blues' fifty grams -- quite the difference. Additionally, the Greens necessitates 105 grams to bottom out, compared to sixty-five grams. This results in a switch that is very difficult to use for gaming due to fast taps requiring prohibitive amounts of force, but feels superb to type on nonetheless.

The Cherry MX Green is a switch that is very similar to the Cherry MX Blue. The green switch still contains the clickiness and tactility of the blues but with one major difference; it is slightly heavier. The green switch requires a force of eighty grams to actuate and 105 grams to bottom out compared to the blue's fifty grams actuation and sixty-five grams to bottom out. This results in a switch that is very difficult to use for gaming but feels great to type on.

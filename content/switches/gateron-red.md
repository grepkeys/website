The Gateron Red is just a clone of the [Cherry MX Red](/switches/cherry-red) but is considered slightly better due to the smoothness of the switch. As explained in the article for the [Gateron Blue](/switches/gateron-blue), the switch is smoother due to Gateron's molding process when making the slider results in smoother plastic and less scratchiness when compared to Cherry's switches.

Just like the MX Red, this switch is linear and requires 45g of force to actuate with an actuation point of 2 millimeters.

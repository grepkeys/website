title: "Cherry MX Clear"
---
The Cherry MX Clear is very similar to the Cherry MX Brown in the way that it has a slight bump but it is slightly heavier. The clear switches require a force of 65g to actuate while brown switches require 45g to actuate. The clears are most frequently used as a spacebar on keyboards with brown switches.

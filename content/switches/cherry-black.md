The Cherry MX Black is a heavier version of the Cherry MX Red. The red switches have an actuation force of forty-five grams but the black switches have an actuation force of sixty grams. Similar to the Cherry MX Green, the heavier weight of the black switches has resulted in it becoming favoured for typing over gaming.

The Cherry MX Black is a heavier version of the [Cherry MX Red](/switches/cherry-red). The only difference between the two switches is the actuation force, with the original Red switches having an actuation force of forty-five grams, but with the Black switches have an actuation force of sixty grams. Similar to the [Cherry MX Green](/switches/cherry-green), the heavier weight of the Black switch has resulted in it being favoured for typing over gaming. Despite this, however, more clicky switches such as [Blues](/switches/cherry-blue) (and [its derivatives](/switches/cherry-green)) are usually more ideal for typing.

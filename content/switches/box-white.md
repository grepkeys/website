The Kailh Box White is a clone of the [Cherry MX Blue](/switches/cherry-blue) with a different style of stem similar to the newer versions of Razer switches. This stem was designed to make the switch more durable to dust and moisture. The Box White's only difference to the MX Blue is a slightly shortened actuation distance of 1.8 millimetres compared to the MX Blue's 2.2 millimetre actuation point.

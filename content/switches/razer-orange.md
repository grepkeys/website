The Razer Orange is Razer's attempt at making a replacement for the [Cherry MX Brown](/switches/cherry-brown). It shares many characteristics with the MX Brown such as a subtle bump, 2 millimetre actuation distance and an actuation force of forty grams. 

Just like Razer's other switches, there have been concerns over their claims of an 80 million keystroke durability; especially for older iterations of Razer's switches. Many people have claimed their Razer switches have died long before 80 million keystrokes and, just as explained in the article for the [Razer Yellow](/switches/razer-yellow) the Cherry switches may actually be more durable than Razer's switches despite their claims.

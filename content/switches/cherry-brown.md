The Cherry MX Brown is a very popular switch due to it being a comfortable middle ground between the [Cherry MX Red](/switches/cherry-red) and the [Cherry MX Blue](/switches/cherry-blue). It has the quietness of the Red switch with a slight tactile bump from the Blue switch. This switch has an actuation point of two millimetres, and an operating force of forty-five grams.

However, the Brown switch has created an argument as to whether the Brown switch is a tactile switch as advertised, or a linear switch due to the bump being so subtle. In fact, [the authors of this website](/contact) are undecided on whether the Brown switch really is tactile.

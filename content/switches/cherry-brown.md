The Cherry MX Brown is a very popular switch due to it being a comfortable middle ground between the Cherry MX Red and the Cherry MX Blue. It has the quietness of the red switch with a slight tactile bump from the blue switch. This switch has an actuation point of 2mm and an operating force of 45g.

The brown switch has however created an argument as to whether the brown switch is a tactile switch as advertised or a linear switch due to the bump being so subtle.

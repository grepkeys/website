The Cherry MX Red is a linear switch manufactured by the popular mechanical switch brand Cherry. These switches are generally regarded as one of the best switches for gaming due to their linearity. *Linear* means that the switch lacks any kind of tactile bump or click at all. Linearity, however, removes any feedback to whether a keystroke has registered, save bottoming out. This can make for a bit of a learning curve for new users.

The low operating force of forty-five grams and a two millimetre actuation point, combined with a lack of tactility, makes the Cherry MX Red an easy recommendation for gaming.

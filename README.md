# GrepKeys â€“ the best way to find your perfect keyboard.

Just a tiny website that will host a relatively small collection of mechanical keyboards reviews, including information on their switches.

## Notes & Todo

- For every keyboard or switch please add a photo of it into `static/img`, with the filename being the same as the corresponding markdown file but with the extension changed to `.jpg`.
- Need to actually write content
- Add links to Amazon for keyboards
- Add list of switches a keyboard is available with to its markdown front matter, then loop through them with Hugo to show a little line of clickable switch icons.
- Show an Amazon 'Buy' button on each keyboard's page (possibly fall back to other retailers if not available on Amazon)

<!-- Usage: -->
<!-- .path = path to image, relative to /assets/ -->
<!-- .alt = alt-text of image -->
<!-- .width = width image will be resized to -->

<!-- We wrap the entire partial in an if statement that checks for the -->
<!-- image's existence not because we will ever publish an article without -->
<!-- an image, but because otherwise, during the writing of articles that -->
<!-- don't yet have images, Hugo will error and the writer will not be able -->
<!-- to view a preview of what the article will look like once published. -->
{{ if fileExists (printf "/assets/%s" .path) }}
  {{ $img := resources.Get .path }}

  <!-- Use imageConfig function to extract aspect ratio of original image -->
  {{ $imgdata := imageConfig (printf "/assets/%s" .path) }}
  {{ $imgaspect := div (float $imgdata.Height) $imgdata.Width }}

  <!-- Use padding-top hack to create a wrapper div around each image that -->
  <!-- has a fixed aspect ratio the same as the image. This means that the -->
  <!-- layout doesn't jump around as images load. -->
  <div
    class="imgaspectkeep"
    style="padding-top: {{ mul $imgaspect 100 }}%"
  >
    <img
      alt="{{ .alt }}"
      src='{{ ($img.Resize .width).Permalink }}'
    >
  </div>
{{ end }}
